# Win8StyleVolumeBar
This program adds a volume bar to your acreen that appears when the volume is changed, and disappears after a while.

It was made to look like the volume bar that appears on Windows 8 and above.

The sole reason this exiats is because I dualboot Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, and I wanted a volumebar for Win7.  
I tried looking for one, but none of them had exact numbers. So I made my own.
